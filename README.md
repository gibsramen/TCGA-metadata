# TCGA-metadata

I have often found it very tedious to pull metadata from TCGA. This is especially the case when matching file UUIDs to case IDs, a process that I feel is needlessly complicated through TCGA. To this end I have started downloading metadata from TCGA and have organized it in such a way that I think would be helpful to other researchers. If you have suggestions on further metadata to include, submit a pull request or open an issue and I'll see what I can do.
